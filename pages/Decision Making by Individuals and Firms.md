  An **explicit cost** is a cost that involves actually laying out money. #definition

  An **implicit cost** is a cost not measured in monetary value, but rather benefits that are foregone. #definition

  The **accounting profit** is total revenue minus explicit costs and depreciation. #definition

  **Marginal cost** of producing a good or service is the additional cost incurred by producing one more unit of a good or service. #definition 
  #+END_PINNED
	- e.g.  if you are making 100 cakes, by the time you get to the 100th cake you will be tired, hence you have to put more effort (= higher cost) into the cake, so the ==marginal cost== will be higher

  **Marginal benefit** of producing a good or service is the additional benefit earned from one or more unit of that good or service. #definition
  #+END_PINNED
	- The more you have of something, the less you will want more of it. Hence, *marginal benefit curve* has a negative slope.

  **Sunk cost** is the cost that has already been incurred and it is *non-recoverable*.

	- They have no bearing on the future and can be ignored.
- # Behavioral Economics
	- *Behavioral economics* focuses on when people make irrational decisions.
	- Four reasons people might rationally choose a worse payoff:
		- Concerns about fairness (helping others might sometimes trump self-interest)

		- Non-monetary rewards (e.g. going on a holiday)
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Bounded rationality (when the option is "good enough", but not necessarily the one with the best payoff)
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Risk aversion (willingness to sacrifice some economic payoff in order to avoid a potential loss)
