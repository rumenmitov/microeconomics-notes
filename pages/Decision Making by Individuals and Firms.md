  **Marginal cost** of producing a good or service is the additional cost incurred by producing one more unit of a good or service. #definition

	- e.g.  if you are making 100 cakes, by the time you get to the 100th cake you will be tired, hence you have to put more effort (= higher cost) into the cake, so the ==marginal cost== will be higher

  **Marginal benefit** of producing a good or service is the additional benefit earned from one or more unit of that good or service. #definition

	- The more you have of something, the less you will want more of it. Hence, *marginal benefit curve* has a negative slope.
