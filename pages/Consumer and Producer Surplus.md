	- ## Changes in prices affects consumer surpluses
		- e.g. fall of price increases consumer surplus:
			- gain to consumers who would have bought at original price
			- gain to consumers persuaded to buy at lower price

	- ## Why do markets work so efficiently?
		- Maximize the *total surplus* of consumers and producers.
		- The *efficiency of markets* is why trade is so good
		- At equilibrium:
			- everyone who wants to buy the good at the price gets to buy it
			- everyone who wants to sell at a price can do so
			- *mutually beneficial* -> everyone can benefit from the transaction
				- ==buyer values good more than seller==
			- #+BEGIN_NOTE
			  *Buyers* for whom *price is too high* and *sellers* for whom *price is too low*, will not engage in the market
			  #+END_NOTE
			- i.e. ==no scarcities and efficient allocation of resources==

	  A market is **inefficient** is if there are missed opportunities, some people could be better off without making others worse off.

		- problems in the nature of the goods themselves (e.g. public goods)
