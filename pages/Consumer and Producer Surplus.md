# Consumer Surplus
	- #+BEGIN_PINNED
	  A consumer's **willingness to pay** for a good is the maximum price at which he or she would buy that good.

	- #+BEGIN_PINNED
	  **Individual consumer surplus** is the net gain to an individual buyer from the purchase of a good. 
	  equal to difference between the buyer's willingness to pay and the price paid.

	  **Total consumer surplus** is the sum of the individual  consumer surpluses. 
	  #+END_PINNED
	- some info here
	- Total consumer surplus is the *area* between the *demand curve* and the *equilibrium price*.
	- graph 09:13
	- Factors that change consumer surplus:
		- Changing prices
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- e.g. fall of price increases consumer surplus:
				- gain to consumers who would have bought at original price
				- gain to consumers persuaded to buy at lower price

	  **Cost**

	  **Individual producer surplus** is the net gain to a seller from selling a good.
	  equal to price received and the sellers cost

	- area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price
	- Factors that change producer surplus
		- Changes in prices
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- e.g. increase in prices of goods
				- benefit to original priducers
				- benefit to new suppliers

	- Why do markets work so efficiently?
		- Maximize the *total surplus* of consumers and producers.
	- The *efficiency of markets* is why trade is so good
	- At equilibrium:
		- Everyone who wants to buy the good at the price gets to buy it
		- Everyone who wants to sell at a price can do so
		- Mutually beneficial -> everyone can benefit from the transaction
			- Buyer values good more than seller
		- NOTE: buyers for whom price is too high and sellers for whom price is too low, will not engage in the market
		- i.e. no scarcities and efficient allocation of resources
	- Why do markets work so well?
		- Property rights -> rights of owners of items to do as they choose with said items
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Economic signals i.e. price as scarcity
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- NOTE: price reflects scarcity
	- NOTE: the market does not imply best outcome for every buyer and seller, it just maximizes the best outcome

	  A market is **inefficient** is if there are missed opportunities, some people could be better off without making others worse off.

	- Factors of *market failure*:
		- externalities
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- problems in the nature of the goods themselves (e.g. public goods)
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- market power
