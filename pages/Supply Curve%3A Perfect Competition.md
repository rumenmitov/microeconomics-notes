  The **optimal output rule** states that profit is maximized by producing the quantity of output at which the marginal cost of the last unit produced is equal to its marginal revenue (= *price*). #definition

  If total revenue > total cost, firm is *profitable*.
  
  If total revenue = total cost, firm is *breaks even*.

	  The lower *elasticity* of the long-term supply curve is due to the fact that it is easier to change up costs in the long-run.
