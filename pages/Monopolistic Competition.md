  **Monopolistic competition** is a market structure in which there are:
  - *many competing producers*
  - each producer sells a *differentiated product*
  - there is *free entry into and exit* from the industry in the *long run*

- Since there are many producers, *collusion* is difficult. Hence, ==product differentiation== is the only way to gain *market power*.
- Examples of product differentiation:
	- Style / type (e.g. sedans vs SUVs)
	- Location
	- Quality
