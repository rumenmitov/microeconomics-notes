- # Production Possibility Frontier (PPF)
	- Graphical model
	- Illustrates trade-offs an economy faces when producing _two_ goods
	- Shows maximum quantity of one good that can be produced at the expense of the other
	- Economic growth results in outward shift of the PPF curve
	- Trade can take the amount of goods available past the PPF curve

	  **Comparative advantage** is when the opportunity cost of producing a good is lower for one party than it is for the other (i.e. when one party is *more efficient* than the other). #definition

	- #+BEGIN_PINNED
	  **Absolute advantage** is when one party can produce a bigger quantity of goods than the other (i.e. when one party is *better* than the other). #definition 
	  #+END_PINNED
	- Trade is generally beneficial for both parties.
		- Ethical issues (e.g. labor laws and environmental concerns) can impact trade relations

			- In terms of coconuts:
				- a coconut costs for Tom $\frac{4}{3}$ fish
				- for Hank it costs $\frac{1}{2}$ fish
			- Thus, even though Tom has an absolute advantage, it is still more beneficial for him to specialize in coconuts and trade for fish, since Hank has a comparative advantage in fish

			  Specializing also come with other benefits e.g. production can become more efficient.
