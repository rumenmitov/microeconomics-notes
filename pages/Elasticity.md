- Unit Elasticity Formula #formula

	  Consider demand curve: *Q = a - bP*
	  
	  First we need to find where elasticity = 1. That would be when total revenue (TR) is either maximum or minimum. We know that:
	  
	  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
	  \text{TR} = P \times Q = P \times (a - bP) = aP - bP^2 \\
	  \text{So:} \\
	  \frac{\delta{\text{TR}}}{\delta{P}} = a -2bP = 0 \text{ (we are trying to find extrema)} \\
	  \implies P = \frac{a}{2b} \\
	  \text{Taking the second derivative we get: } \\
	  \frac{\delta^2{\text{TR}}}{\delta{P}^2} = -2b \\
	  \text{Plugging in our extrema into our second derivative gives us a negative value.} \\
	  \therefore \text{ Point is a maximum.}
	  #+END_EXPORT
	  
	  If we go beyond that point, TR will drop which happens when region is elastic.

- Price elasticity of demand is determined by:
	- availability of *substitutes*
	- whether good is *necessity* or a *luxury*
	- *share of income* spent on good
	- time
		- people find *substitutes* to mitigate price increases $\implies$ *elastic* in the long run
	- inputs
		- more readily *available inputs* $\implies$ *higher elasticity*
