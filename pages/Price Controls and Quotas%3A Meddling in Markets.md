  *Market equilibrium* may not be satisfactory if the *equilibrium price* is too high, which will price out many consumers out. The market may be working *efficiently*, since there is a balance between *consumers* and *producers*.

	- Negative effects:
		- there is an *inefficient allocation* to consumers.
		- wasted resources e.g. search costs
		- inefficiently low quality
		- black markets

		- loss of consumer surplus
		- loss of supplier surplus
- ## Price floors
	- e.g. minimum wage
