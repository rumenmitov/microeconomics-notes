		- Opportunity cost per submarine (s) in terms of millions of tons of strawberries (t)
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- *A*: 
			  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
			  1s = \frac{1000t}{4} = 250t
			  #+END_EXPORT
			- *D*: 
			  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
			  1s = \frac{550t}{3} \approx 183.33t
			  #+END_EXPORT
			- a) falls
		- b) eliminate its production of strawberries
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Cost of staples (s) in terms of cars (c) per country:
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- *A*: 
			  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
			  1s = \frac{35c}{25} = 1.4c
			  #+END_EXPORT
			- *B*: 
			  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
			  1s = \frac{40c}{45} \approx 0.89c
			  #+END_EXPORT
			- It is cheaper for *B* to produce staples, so *B* should specialize in staples and *A* in cars.
		- The opportunity of seeing Rihanna is $50 - $40 = $10. I would be losing these $10 if I went to see Calvin Harris (whose concert is free). Hence, b).
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Cost of steel (s) in terms of automobiles (a):
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- *U.S.*: 
			  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
			  1s = \frac{250a}{25} = 10a
			  #+END_EXPORT
			- *Japan*: 
			  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
			  1s = \frac{275a}{30} \approx 9.17a
			  #+END_EXPORT
			- It is cheaper for *Japan* to produce steel and for the *U.S.* to produce automobiles. Hence d).
		- The length of each line will be the same because people seek the least wait so they will always join the shortest line. When too many people join the shortest line it will become the same as the others. Meanwhile, no one will go to the longest queue, so it too will become of normal length.
