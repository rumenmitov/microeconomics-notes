		- In a perfectly competitive market, the market demand curve is downward sloping. Answer is c). ✅
		- In a perfectly competitive market the individual producer is a price-taker, hence their individual demand curve is a straight line. Answer is b).
		- In order for the firm to remain operational its marginal cost (= marginal revenue) must be higher than the average variable cost, other wise the firm will not be able to cover the wages of its employees. Answer is d). ✅
		- #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
		  \text{average fixed cost} = \frac{\text{fixed cost}}{\text{quantity}} = \frac{\$100}{100 bushels} = 1 \frac{\$}{\text{bushel}}
		  #+END_EXPORT
		  
		  
		  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
		  \text{average economic profit} = \text{average total revenue} - \text{average total costs} = \frac{\$450}{100 \text{ bushels}} - 1.75 \frac{\$}{\text{bushel}} = 2.75 \frac{\$}{\text{bushel}}
		  #+END_EXPORT
		  
		  
		  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
		  \text{average variable cost} = \text{average total cost} - \text{average fixed cost} = 1.75 \frac{\$}{\text{bushel}} - \frac{\$100}{100 \text{ bushels}} = 0.75 \frac{\$}{\text{bushel}}
		  #+END_EXPORT
		  
		  
		  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
		  \text{economic profit} = \text{total revenue} - \text{total costs} = \$450 - 1.75 \frac{\$}{\text{bushel}} \times 100 \text{ bushels} = \$ 275
		  #+END_EXPORT
		  
		  Hence, answer is b). ✅
		- Since firm is in a perfectly competitive market, the marginal cost should be equal to price. Meaning the firm is already operating at a profit-maximizing level. We need to check if that profit is enough to cover the variable costs.
		  
		  
		  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
		  \text{average variable cost} = \text{average total cost} - \text{average fixed cost} = 6 \frac{\$}{\text{unit}} - 2 \frac{\$}{\text{unit}} = 4 \frac{\$}{\text{unit}}
		  #+END_EXPORT
		  
		  
		  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
		  \text{total revenue} = \text{price} = 3 \frac{\$}{\text{unit}}
		  #+END_EXPORT
		  
		  The firm's revenue will not be able to cover its variable cost, so it should shut down. Answer is c). ✅

		- A monopolist can affect the prices, whereas a perfectly competitive firm cannot. Hence, the monopolist has a downward-sloping demand curve, whereas the firm has a straight curve. Answer is d). ✅
		- #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
		  \text{quantity effect} = \Delta \text{quantity} \times \text{price} = 1 \times \$20000 = \$20000
		  #+END_EXPORT
		  
		  Answer is a). ✅

		- Increase in demand, means demand curve is shifted right, hence the monopoly can increase input and increase output. Answer is b). ✅
		- At point N, the firm's average total cost is higher than the revenue received by the demand for the product. Hence firm is operating at a loss. Similarly, marginal revenue is less than 0, meaning the firm will never be profit-maximizing. Answer is c). ✅
		- At the equilibrium, MC = MR. Hence, ATC is at point B. And ATC will be the price at S, multiplied by the quantity at J, this is represented by the rectangle OSBJ. Answer is d). ✅
		- The monopolist has a downward-sloping demand curve, like the industry demand curve in a competitive market. Answer is d). ✅
		- Price discrimination is changing your prices for different groups of buyers. Answer is c). ✅
