		  Answer is c). ✅
		- Since 0.37 < 1, demand is inelastic, so answer is b). ✅
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- E = 0.2, since 0.2 < 1 demand is inelastic. Answer is a). ✅
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Answer is d). If a good is a necessity, then people are less likely to stop buying it even if the price changes. ✅
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- People need the good, and due to the lack of available substitutes they will likely keep purchasing the good, despite price changes. Answer is b). ✅
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Due to decrease in the supply, supply curve is shifted left. The farmers would profit from this if demand is inelastic, because then the farmers would be selling more or less the same amount of quantity for higher prices. Since the output effect is that quantity decreases, and the price effect is that price increases, then the price effect should outweigh the output effect, so that the farmers benefit. Answer is a). ✅
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- First we need to find where elasticity = 1. That would be when total revenue (TR) is either maximum or minimum. We know that:
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		  
		  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
		  \text{TR} = P \times Q = P \times (a - bP) = aP - bP^2 \\
		  \text{So:} \\
		  \frac{\delta{\text{TR}}}{\delta{P}} = a -2bP = 0 \text{ (we are trying to find extrema)} \\
		  \implies P = \frac{a}{2b} \\
		  \text{Taking the second derivative we get: } \\
		  \frac{\delta^2{\text{TR}}}{\delta{P}^2} = -2b \\
		  \text{Plugging in our extrema into our second derivative gives us a negative value.} \\
		  \therefore \text{ Point is a maximum.}
		  #+END_EXPORT
		  
		  If we go beyond that point, TR will drop which happens when region is elastic. ✅

			- We want to find where total revenue (TR) is maximum.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			  
			  Supply:
			  
			  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
			  \text{TR} = P \times Q = P \times (1800 + 240P) = 1800P - 240P^2 \\
			  \text{So:} \\
			  \frac{\delta{\text{TR}}}{\delta{P}} = 1800 - 480P = 0 \text{ (we are trying to find extrema)} \\
			  \implies P = \frac{1800}{480} = 3.75 \\
			  #+END_EXPORT
			  
			  Demand:
			  
			  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
			  \text{TR} = P \times Q = P \times (3550 - 266P) = 3550P - 266P^2 \\
			  \text{So:} \\
			  \frac{\delta{\text{TR}}}{\delta{P}} = 3550 - 532P = 0 \text{ (we are trying to find extrema)} \\
			  \implies P = \frac{3550}{532} = 10.09 \text{ (2 d.p.)} \\
			  #+END_EXPORT
			  
			  When P=4:
			  
			  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
			  Q_D = 3550 - 266 \times 4 = 2486
			  #+END_EXPORT
			  
			  The price of elasticity of demand will stay the same. It will be the price of elasticity of supply that will change, because it was that the supply curve affected.
