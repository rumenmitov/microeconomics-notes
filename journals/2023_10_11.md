			- Price per pound of milk is $0.10, and surplus is (170 - 169) = 1 billion of pounds of milk, hence:
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			  
			  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
			  \text{money spent} = \$0.10 \text{ per pound of milk} \times 1 \times 10^9 \text{ pounds of milk} = \$10^8
			  #+END_EXPORT
			  
			  ✅
			- logseq.order-list-type:: number
			  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
			  \text{total surplus} = \$3.38 \times 10^9 + \$6.80 \times 10^9  - \$10^8 = \$10.08 \times 10^9
			  #+END_EXPORT
			  
			  We can see that total surplus after the price floor will be lower.

			  Equilibrium wage is €30 000.
			  Equilibrium number of graduates hired is 290 000.
			  In theory, all job seekers at the equilibrium wage will find a job as there is an equal amount of job seekers and job offerings at the equilibrium.

			  At €35 000 minimum wage, there will be 60 000 job-seekers without a job.
			  At €40 000 minimum wage, there will be 100 000 job-seekers without a job.
			  
			  ✅
			- We can see that there is a positive correlation between the minimum wage and the involuntary unemployment. The beneficiaries will be the employed people who were willing to get paid below market wages. The losers are the employers because the cost of business will increase. and in general the job-seekers as it will get harder to land a job, as there will be limited spots.

			  ⚠️ *Missed opportunity is that you have a lot of people who can work, but are not employed.*
