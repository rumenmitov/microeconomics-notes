		- Oligopoly is characterized by the small number of interdependent firms. Answer is c). ✅
		- The market share of a monopoly is 100, hence the HHI will be $10^2 = 10000$. Answer is d). ✅
		- A firm in a cartel is incentivized to increase output. Answer is a). ✅
		- Nash equilibrium is when the two parties play the dominant strategy. Answer is d). ✅
		- The dominant strategy is the best outcome, regardless of the actions of the other party. Hence both parties will increase their outputs so answer is b). ✅
		- Nash equilibrium is when both firms will play the dominant strategy. Answer is c). ✅

		- In monopolistic competition products are differentiated, but over time firms do not face barriers to entry. Hence answer is a). ✅
		- If firm is making a profit that means that the demand is greater than the average total cost. However if by increasing output the firm can increase profits, that must be because marginal revenue is less than marginal cost. Answer is a). ✅
		- Panel b is operating at a loss because demand is less than average total cost at equilibrium. Answer is b). ✅
		- Since Toby is maximizing profits we know that marginal revenue equals marginal cost. And since Toby is operating at minimum average total cost, marginal cost is equal to average total cost.  Hence answer is c). ✅
		- Firm is making a profit. In the long run more firms will enter the market, until the profit is 0. Hence there will be less demand for the firm's products as there are substitutes. Answer is c). ✅
		- Product differentiation lets the firm act as a monopoly. Hence it faces a downward sloping demand curve. Answer is c). ✅
		- A fixed cost changing affects only the average total cost, which in turn impacts only the economic profit. Hence c). ✅
