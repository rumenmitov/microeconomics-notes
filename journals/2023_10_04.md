		- He his willing to pay $10, but pays only $5, hence his consumer surplus is $5.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Consumer surplus is $0, since max price he is willing to pay is $10 and he pays $10.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- This is non-applicable since Stacey is priced out of the market.
