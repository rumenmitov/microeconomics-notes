		- Marginal product of labor describes how much the output changes with one extra unit of labor. Since the growth of the curve between A and B is falling off, the marginal product of labor is falling. Answer: c). ✅
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- There is diminishing returns, but also the total output is increasing, hence answer is d). ✅
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Fixed costs are $2500 because the labor and the electricity bill can be tweaked in the short-run. Answer: a). ✅
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- The cost of the twentieth worker is $60, and he can produce an additional 12 units. Hence, marginal cost of the last unit produced by the last worker would be:
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		  
		  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
		  \text{marginal cost} = \frac{\$60}{12} = \$5
		  #+END_EXPORT
		  
		  ✅
		- If marginal cost is decreasing, that means that there is a lower variable cost, but in order to compensate for the lower amount of labor, the marginal product must increase. Hence answer is d). ✅

		- 8500; ATC(3 workers) = TC(3 workers)/output (3 workers) = 50, ATC(4 workers) = 50; 130 * P = 6500 => P = 50
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		  a)
		  
		  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
		  \text{total cost (4 workers)} = \$500 + 4 * \$2000 = \$8500
		  #+END_EXPORT
		  
		  ✅
		  
		  b)
		  Lowest ATC occurs with 3 workers or with 4 workers. 
		  
		  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
		  \text{average total cost (3 workers)} = \frac{\text{total cost (3 workers)}}{\text{output (3 workers)}} = \frac{\$500 + 3 * \$2000}{130} = \$50
		  #+END_EXPORT
		  
		  
		  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
		  \text{average total cost (4 workers)} = \frac{\text{total cost (4 workers)}}{\text{output (4 workers)}} = \frac{\$500 + 4 * \$2000}{170} = \$50
		  #+END_EXPORT
		  
		  ✅
		  
		  c)
		  Breakeven occurs when ATC = Price, hence she must charge $50. ✅
