		- Tax will reduce revenue of suppliers, so a). ✅
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- ❌ *d)* because:
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		  
		  
		  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
		  
		  #+END_EXPORT
		- Price will remain constant, d). ✅
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- {{renderer excalidraw, excalidraw-2023-10-25-09-35-48}}
		- Demand is elastic, while supply is inelastic. It follows that it gets slightly more expensive for the consumer, but the suppliers will lose a lot of customers. Hence suppliers have to deal with the brunt of the tax, a). ✅
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- {{renderer excalidraw, excalidraw-2023-10-25-09-54-24}}
		- Since demand is perfectly inelastic, a tax of $10 per unit will increase the price that consumers pay by $10 per unit, c). ✅
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- {{renderer excalidraw, excalidraw-2023-10-25-10-01-23}}
		- When both are elastic, then the area between the curves will be minimal because the tax point will be closer to the equilibrium. Hence d). ✅
