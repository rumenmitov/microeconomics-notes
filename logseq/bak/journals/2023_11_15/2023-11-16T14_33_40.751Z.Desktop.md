		  \$5 \times -\$0.25x = \$2.75 \\

		  She should eat 9 sushis, plus the first one, hence 10 sushi. Answer is b).
		- logseq.order-list-type:: number
		  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
		  \$11 + \$11 + \$13 + \$15 = \$50
		  #+END_EXPORT
		  
		  Answer is c).
		- Initial investment is \$1000, at an interest of 7%. After 2 years, benefits are $3000, costs are $1910.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		  
		  
		  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
		  \text{NPV} = \frac{\$0 - \$1000}{(1+0.07)^0} + \frac{\$3000 - \$1910}{(1+0.07)^2} = -\$47.95 \text{ (2 d.p.)}
		  #+END_EXPORT
		- logseq.order-list-type:: number
		  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
		  \text{marginal utility}_2 = 35 - 20 = 15
		  #+END_EXPORT
		  
		  Answer is b).
		- logseq.order-list-type:: number
		  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
		  \text{total utility}_2 = 200 + 150 = 350
		  #+END_EXPORT
		  
		  Answer is c).
		- If Freddy doesn't care about the price and he is sick of the product, that means that the next unit of the product will have negative utility. Answer is b).
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Maximum number of scones remains unchanged since only the price of tea changes. Hence answer is d).
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- logseq.order-list-type:: number
		  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
		  \$100 = 10 \text{ tacos} = 50 \text{ milkshakes} \\
		  1 \text{ milkshake} = \frac{1}{5} \text{ tacos} \\
		  \implies \text{gradient} = 0.2
		  #+END_EXPORT
		- Optimal consumption bundle means that:
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		  
		  
		  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
		  \frac{MU_X}{\text{price of X}} = \frac{MU_Y}{\text{price of Y}}
		  #+END_EXPORT
		  
		  
		  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
		  \implies \text{ price of Y} = \frac{\$12}{3} = \$4
		  #+END_EXPORT
